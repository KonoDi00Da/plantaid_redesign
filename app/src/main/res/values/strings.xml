    <string name="h1">How to identify a plant?</string>
    <string name="h2">Make sure your plant is in the figure and the lighting is good before taking a picture. Flowers, leaves, or a complete plant can all be captured on camera. Avoid combining several species in one frame because this can cause identification errors. Minimize potential dark, overexposed, and blurry photos as well. If you\'re unhappy with the outcomes, try again while following to the following important advice.</string>
    <string name="h3">How many plants can PlantAid identify?</string>
    <string name="h4">The picture of a user\'s plant can be taken, and an automatic list of plants with similar appearances and their popular and scientific names will be displayed. 38,700 plant species are the maximum allowed by the plant identification system.
